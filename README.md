# Speedrun.com Analytics

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## How To Run
Run `npm install` from the command line in the project directory to install the necessary components then run the command `ng build` from the command line to build the project. Then...

The pages of the most popular games/users often take between 5-10 seconds to load the page. Similarly, the results for searching for a user can take 4-5+ seconds. This is primarily due to the Speedrun.com API which sometimes slows down it's response speeds when the amount of requests increases to higher than normal levels (even on the Speedrun.com website searching can take 5+ seconds for results to show). I have not run into any issues with pages not loading at all after 10+ seconds but if that does happen then refreshing the page should cause it to load properly.

## Summary
https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api

## Requirements (18/20)
1. Requests to Speedrun.com's API (i.e. Data gathering) (5/5)
The DataService class is an injectable class that provides functions to make calls to the Speedrun.com API and returns data about games, users, runs, categories, records, and leaderboards. The class mitigates the issues with Speedrun.com's API rate limit of 100 requests per minute as best as possible to still retrieve as much useful information as quickly as possible.

2. Main Page (4/5)
The main/home page of the project provides summaries and links to the top five most popular games on Speedrun.com based on the number of unique players and submitted speedruns of those games. It also provides statistics about recent activity on the site and which games & users are the most active.

3. Search Bar + Game / User pages (9/10)
The Search component is displayed on the main page and allows users to search for a game or user. Game results are generated by referencing the stored list of games and user results are generated by making requests to the API. The list of games is stored for a couple of reasons, one to avoid unnecessary API calls and the list of games contains ~20,000 entires while the number of users on the site is over 850,000. Each search result links to a specific page with summaries, links, graphs, and statistics about a game or user.

## Validity (4.5/5)
This project was designed to be used through a computer web browser however each page is responsive and will resize it's graphics, text, and graphs to to fit a range of screen sizes, including mobile device screens. 

## Documentation (5/5)
The project's code is thoroughly commented and the project's interface is very straightforward on each page with navigation links which highlight on hover.

## Total: (27.5/30)
